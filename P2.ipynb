    "## Project: **Advanced Lane Finding on the Road** \n",
    "***\n",
    "In this project, I used the tools I learned about in the lessons in udacity to track lane by getting segmentation on the road image, which is succeeded project from the [previous one](https://github.com/Akitsuyoshi/CarND-LaneLines-P1). Like the previous project, percepron in autonomous vehicle is for getting where it is on the road. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also I may use some of the function that I made in the last project to identify some feature in images. I found that there's two ways to deal with those segmentation deep learning and using computer vision soft, like opencv manually. Deep learning sounds cool but I might need some practice for that, so I chose to use python and opencv aproach instead. Still it is a cutting edge tech I suppose,,,\n",

    "Aside from implementing code here, there is a brif writeup in readme to complete this project.\n",

    "The tools that I will use in this project to detect lane lines and determine the lane curvature are following.\n",
    "* Camera calibration\n",
    "* Distortion correction\n",

    "* Perspective transform\n",
    "\n",
    "Above that, I might use tools below that I used previous project. I put it here to remember for my own sake.\n",
    "* color selection\n",
    "* region of interest selection\n",
    "* grayscaling\n",
    "* Gaussian smoothing\n",
    "* Canny Edge Detection and Hough Transform"
